// The differences between null and undefined are subtle, but very important. 

// null is an object that indicates a deliberate non-value.

const nullValue = null; // null

// undefined is a primitive value that indicates an uninitialized or missing value. In other words, null is for when you mean nothing, and undefined is for when you mean something is there, but you donâ€™t know what it is.
let undefinedValue; // undefined
