// Transpiling in JavaScript refers to the process of converting source code written in one version of JavaScript (ES6+, TypeScript, etc.) into an older version that can be executed in environments that do not support the latest language features. This is typically done using a transpiler like Babel.

// Example:

// ES6+ code using arrow functions
// const myFunction = () => {
//   console.log('Hello, world!');
//   };
  
  // Transpiled code targeting ES5
  // var myFunction = function myFunction() {
  // console.log('Hello, world!');
  // };
  
  // Transpiling affects the code in the following ways:
  
  // Transpiling allows developers to use the latest language features while ensuring compatibility with older browsers and environments that do not support those features natively.
  
  // Transpiled code may lose some of the syntactic sugar and readability of the original code, as it often introduces additional boilerplate code to emulate newer language features in older versions.
  
  // Depending on the transpilation process and the specific language features being transpiled, there may be a slight impact on performance due to the additional code introduced during transpilation.
