// eval() should be avoided because it can be a security risk. Some of the reasons are:
// 1. It can execute any code passed to it.
// 2. It can access the scope in which it was called.
// 3. It can execute code in the global scope.
// 4. It can change the value of variables in the scope in which it was called.
