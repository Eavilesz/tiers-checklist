// JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation and is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy to read and write and is based on a subset of the JavaScript programming language. JSON is often used to serialize and transmit data between a server and a web application.

// {
//   "name": "John Doe",
//   "age": 30,
//   "email": "john.doe@example.com",
//   "address": {
//     "street": "123 Main Street",
//     "city": "Anytown",
//     "state": "CA",
//     "zipcode": "12345"
//   },
//   "hobbies": ["reading", "hiking", "photography"],
//   "isStudent": false
// }

// JSON data is written as key/value pairs. The keys are always strings, and the values can be strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, or null.
