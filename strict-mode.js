// strict mode is a feature introduced in ecmascript 5 that helps to catch common coding mistakes and "unsafe" actions. It also helps to prevent certain types of bugs and improve performance.
// An example of a common mistake that strict mode catches is the use of undeclared variables. In non-strict mode, if you try to assign a value to an undeclared variable, it will create a global variable. In strict mode, this will throw an error.
